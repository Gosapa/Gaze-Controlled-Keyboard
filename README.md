# Gaze Controlled Keyboard
Control a keyboard with just your gaze, using only a standard webcam. This project is designed to assist individuals with limited limb mobility.

## Features
- Gaze-Controlled Input: Type by controlling the keyboard with left/right gaze movements and character selection via blinking.
- Efficient Selection: Utilizes a binary-search-like method for rapid character selection.
- System-Wide Compatibility: Functions with any text editor (e.g., Notepad) by simulating hardward keyboard input
- Korean Language Support: Currently supports Korean, with future updates planned for additional languages.
